  In this paper we study an emerging class of neural networks based on the morphological operators of
  dilation and erosion. We explore these networks mathematically from a tropical geometry perspective
  as well as mathematical morphology. Our contributions are threefold. First, we examine the training
  of morphological networks via Difference-of-Convex programming methods and extend a binary
  morphological classifier to multiclass tasks. Second, we focus on the sparsity of dense morphological
  networks trained via gradient descent algorithms and compare their performance to their linear
  counterparts under heavy pruning, showing that the morphological networks cope far better and
  are characterized with superior compression capabilities. Our approach incorporates the effect of
  the training optimizer used and offers quantitative and qualitative explanations. Finally, we study
  how the architectural structure of a morphological network can affect shape constraints, focusing on
  monotonicity. Via Maslov Dequantization, we obtain a softened version of a known architecture and
  show how this approach can improve training convergence and performance.
