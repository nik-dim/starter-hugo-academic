abstract: |-
  n this paper, we study an emerging class of neural networks, the
  Morphological Neural networks, from some modern perspectives.
  Our approach utilizes ideas from tropical geometry and mathemati-
  cal morphology. First, we state the training of a binary morpholog-
  ical classifier as a Difference-of-Convex optimization problem and
  extend this method to multiclass tasks. We then focus on general
  morphological networks trained with gradient descent variants and
  show, quantitatively via pruning schemes as well as qualitatively,
  the sparsity of the resulted representations compared to FeedForward
  networks with ReLU activations as well as the effect the training op-
  timizer has on such compression techniques. Finally, we show how
  morphological networks can be employed to guarantee monotonic-
  ity and present a softened version of a known architecture, based on
  Maslov Dequantization, which alleviates issues of gradient propaga-
  tion associated with its “hard” counterparts and moderately improves
  performance.
