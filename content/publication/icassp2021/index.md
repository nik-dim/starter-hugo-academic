  In this paper, we study an emerging class of neural networks, the Morphological Neural networks, from some modern perspectives. Our approach utilizes ideas from tropical geometry and mathematical morphology. First, we state the training of a binary morphological classifier as a Difference-of-Convex optimization problem and extend this method to multiclass tasks. We then focus on general  morphological networks trained with gradient descent variants and show, quantitatively via pruning schemes as well as qualitatively, the sparsity of the resulted representations compared to FeedForward networks with ReLU activations as well as the effect the raining optimizer has on such compression techniques. Finally, we show how  morphological networks can be employed to guarantee monotonicity and present a softened version of a known architecture, based on Maslov Dequantization, which alleviates issues of gradient propagation associated with its “hard” counterparts and moderately improves performance.
