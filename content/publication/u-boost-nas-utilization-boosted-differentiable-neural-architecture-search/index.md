abstract: Optimizing resource utilization in target platforms is key to
  achieving high performance during DNN inference. While optimizations have been
  proposed for inference latency, memory footprint, and energy consumption,
  prior hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS) methods have omitted
  resource utilization, preventing DNNs to take full advantage of the target
  inference platforms. Modeling resource utilization efficiently and accurately
  is challenging, especially for widely-used array-based inference accelerators
  such as Google TPU. In this work, we propose a novel hardware-aware NAS
  framework that does not only optimize for task accuracy and inference latency,
  but also for resource utilization. We also propose and validate a new
  computational model for resource utilization in inference accelerators. By
  using the proposed NAS framework and the proposed resource utilization model,
  we achieve 2.8 - 4x speedup for DNN inference compared to prior hardware-aware
  NAS methods while attaining similar or improved accuracy in image
  classification on CIFAR-10 and Imagenet-100 datasets.
