I am a first year PhD student in Computer Science at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), where I am advised by [François Fleuret](https://fleuret.org/francois/index.html) and [Pascal Frossard](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts4/people/people-current/frossard/). My research interests revolve around machine (and deep) learning, optimization and mathematics. Currently, I am working on Multi-Task Learning and Customer Understanding.

Before coming to Switzerland, I completed my undergraduate studies in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens in Greece. I conducted my thesis (available [here](http://artemis.cslab.ece.ntua.gr:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/17716/3/Nikolaos%20Dimitriadis%20-%20Diploma%20Thesis.pdf) in Greek) at the [CVSP](http://cvsp.cs.ntua.gr/) lab under the supervision of [Petros Maragos](http://cvsp.cs.ntua.gr/maragos/). The focus lied on using tropical geometry to analyze Morphological Neural Networks, studying the sparsity of their representations compared to their linear counterparts, their ability to enforce shape constraints such as monotonicity, and extending a training algorithm based on Difference-of-Convex Programming to multiclass problems.

I am also an avid classical guitar player! I love playing Baroque and romantic pieces, such as compositions by Agustín Barrios Mangoré. Check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEIqk8KPyDY&ab_channel=dvidalroller) beautiful performance!
